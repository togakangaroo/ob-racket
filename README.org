* Org-Mode Babel Support for Racket

This Emacs module enables support for the [[https://racket-lang.org][Racket programming language]] in Emacs'
[[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][Org-mode Babel]]. This allows executing Racket code blocks directly from Org mode,
embedding the results of those code blocks in your Org files, and even chaining
the result from one code block into another code block. See the [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html][Babel intro]] for
more details on what's possible.

** Installation

- Install =ob-racket.el= in your Emacs [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Lisp-Libraries.html#Lisp-Libraries][load path]]
- Add the following to your =.emacs.d= file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Enable Racket in Org-mode Babel
  (org-babel-do-load-languages
   'org-babel-load-languages
   '((racket . t)))
#+END_SRC

- If your Racket interpreter is installed in a non-standard location (anywhere
  other than =/usr/bin/racket=), also add the following to your =.emacs.d= file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Set path to racket interpreter
  (setq org-babel-command:racket "/path/goes/here")
#+END_SRC
